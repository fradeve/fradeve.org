Just a rustic boy.

Hi folks, this is Francesco's blog, originally forked from Fernando 
Paolo's `website`_ (in the abandoned ``old_hyde`` branch), and subsequently 
moved to `Pelican`_ (now abandoned in the ``old_pelican`` brach; I added some 
enhancements to the theme created by `andrewseidl`_).

The current theme is called ``pelicanyan`` and the original author is 
`almet`_.
