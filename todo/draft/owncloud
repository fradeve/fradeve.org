## packages
* fuse-utils
* gvfs
* gvfs-fuse
* davfs2

By default this package is installed so that only root can mount davfs volumes. To mount as other users, you need to set the SUID bit for /sbin/mount.davfs and designate a group whose members can mount davfs volumes. To set the SUID bit, use this command:

sudo chmod u+s /sbin/mount.davfs

You then need to configure davfs so that only members of the group "users" can mount davfs volumes. The config file for davfs is: /etc/davfs/davfs.conf Edit however you like, but to use gedit:

sudo vim /etc/davfs2/davfs2.conf

There should be a line something like:

dav_group $group

This should be changed to:

dav_group users

Now, you should add your user to the users group:

sudo addgroup your-user users

Reboot

sudo chown -R www-data:www-data owncloud

To achieve the same user on the the box.net files and server user, you have to mount the webdav volume as "fradeve" using /etc/fstab
