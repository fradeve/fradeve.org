Hello, this is Francesco de Virgilio's website, originally forked from Fernando Paolo's [website](https://github.com/fspaolo/fspaolo.github.com) (in the abandoned `hyde` branch), and subsequently moved to [Pelican](http://github.com/getpelican/pelican). I've added some enhancements to the theme created by [andrewseidl](https://github.com/andrewseidl):

* featured articles in post list support (`andrewseidl-theme/templates/index.html`); it reads `featured: yes` in metadata
* "last updated" added in articles headings (`andrewseidl-theme/templates/article.html`); it reads `Modified` in metadata
* fixed code CSS to the excellent [Solarized](https://github.com/altercation/solarized)
* a Jinja2 template working with [g.raphael library](http://g.raphaeljs.com) to quickly insert graphs (under works)

All the code from Fernando Paolo is "freely available" as reported from in [his blog](http://fspaolo.net/about/); all the other code is released under GNU GPL v3 licence, see LICENSE; all the javascript libraries are released in full respect of theire own licences.

Feel free to fork and enhance this work under the therms of GPL.
