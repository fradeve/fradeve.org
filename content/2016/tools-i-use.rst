:headline: A minimalistic toolkit for minimalistic developer

In any human activity more complex than harvesting fruit from bushes, a proper 
tool is needed.

Thus, choosing the right tool for a single task is essential to get that task
done properly, and the Unix philosophy has a lot to teach us on this. After many 
years, I still feel that:

* most of the tools we use are overengineered to perform too many tasks
* having a tool aiming to perform too much means having a lot to install on the 
  system, and a lot to configure
* a complex configuration leads to complex backups and recovery systems

This is why, over the course of the last few years, I have been heavily 
considering minimalism when picking my tools.
