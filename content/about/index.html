About this site
---------------

I started this site as a place to keep information, source code and documentation available on the web (mostly for myself). So feel free to grab and modify anything you may find useful (for some inconceivable reason). If you have any comment just send me a [message](mailto:fspaolo@gmail.com).

Why a minimal design?
---------------------

The website design follows a [minimalistic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimalism) approach, most of which are modifications from a [couple](http://typesites.com/) [of](http://usesthis.com/) [amazing](http://www.chamainc.com/) [websites](http://www.ilovetypography.com/) [out](http://www.getfinch.com/blog/) [there](http://www.gilesrevell.com/) (the fact that I like design and typography doesn't mean I am any good at it!). So why a minimal design? In our visually striking polluted world a minimalistic look recovers the simplicity, sophistication and beauty of a clean and modern design. It focus just on the contents' essential, reducing the subject to its fundamental features, and nothing more...
