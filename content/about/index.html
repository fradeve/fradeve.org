About this site
---------------

I've started my blog in 2007 after first approaches with _free software_, to share my enthusiasm, experiences and code, with the aim that someone in the world might find it useful. At this moment most of the posts are in Italian, but may happen in the future that some posts will be in English. Feel free to grab any content anytime and reuse it under the therms of GNU GPL v3 licence.

Design and minimalism
---------------------

The blog, as you see it, has been designed and created by Fernando Paolo. It follows a minimalistic approach and I personally agree with that. This blog can be considered minimalistic for a bunch of reasons:

* it has been crafted and is currently maintained by command-line tools like [Vim](LINK HERE), [Git](LINK HERE)
* its pages are static and have been compiled using [Hyde](LINK HERE) blogging engine
* it is hosted on a minimalistic and low-consuming installation of Ubuntu Server, using as little as 30 Mb RAM and 6% CPU
