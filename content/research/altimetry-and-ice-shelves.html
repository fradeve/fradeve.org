Satellite observations have shown an increase in the rate of mass loss from the Antarctic ice sheet over the past two decades. At the same time, rapid changes have occurred in extent of specific ice shelves, and acceleration of grounded ice streams has followed ice shelf collapses; these observations have been interpreted as evidence that ocean forcing can lead to rapid changes in ice sheet dynamic flow and its subsequent contribution to sea level rise. However, all previous large-scale studies of mass balance of Antarctic ice shelves have been limited to the time period since ERS-1 launch (data since 1992), therefore it is not clear whether the observed trends are representative of the true long-term variability.

We use radar altimeter data from Seasat (NASA), Geosat (US NAVY/NOAA), ERS-1/2 (ESA), GFO (US NAVY) and Envisat (ESA) missions to construct the longest possible history of elevation changes and extend the analyses of surface variability from 1978 to 2010 for all of Antarctica's ice shelves north of 72S (for 72S < lat < 81.5S data are available from 1992 to 2010).
