Hello, this is Francesco de Virgilio's website, originally forked from Fernando Paolo's [website](https://github.com/fspaolo/fspaolo.github.com). I've added some enhancements:

* tag support
* featured articles in post list support
* Atom posts feed
* a Jinja2 template to insert images with link to full image version
* a Jinja2 template working with [g.raphael library](http://g.raphaeljs.com) to quickly insert graphs
* Disqus support
