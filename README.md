Hello, this is Francesco de Virgilio's website, originally forked from Fernando Paolo's [website](https://github.com/fspaolo/fspaolo.github.com). I've added some enhancements:

* tag support (layout/taglist.j2)
* featured articles in post list support (layout/macros.j2)
* Atom posts feed
* a Jinja2 template to insert images with link to full image version (layout/macros.j2)
* a Jinja2 template working with [g.raphael library](http://g.raphaeljs.com) to quickly insert graphs (layout/macros.j2)
* Disqus support

All the code from Fernando Paolo is "freely available" as reported from in [his blog](http://fspaolo.net/about/); all the other code is released under GNU GPL v3 licence, see LICENSE; all the javascript libraries are released in full respect of theire own licences.

Feel free to fork and enhance this work under the therms of GPL.
